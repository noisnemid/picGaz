  this is a config file for python script for win10_login_screen_picture
  gathering version 3.0

  feel free to write the plan schema inside a list or dict
  and just modify the calling style to fit it.

  note that if you write plans like this:
    plan_name:
      src: ...
    
    you should write the calling like this:
      for k,v in p.items():
        UNIQUE_PIC_COPY(v)
        ...
    

plans:
  - name: win10_log_pic
    src: ~/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy/LocalState/Assets
    dst: ~/Downloads/w10logpics
    hash_algorithm: sha256
    filters:
      # if pictures' minimal border is >= this size, then it will be copied.
      # that's because windows 10's login pictures has two dimensions within the asset folder.
      # unit: pixel
      min_border_px: 1024

  - name: test
    src: ~/Desktop/srcTest
    dst: ~/Downloads/w10logpics
    hash_algorithm: sha256
    filters:
      # if pictures' minimal border is >= this size, then it will be copied.
      # that's because windows 10's login pictures has two dimensions within the asset folder.
      # unit: pixel
      min_border_px: 1024
